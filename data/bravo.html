<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am not an organizer of the Bravo Awards 2024 and did not contribute to any of the nominated entries (except for <a href="#best-non-puzzle-contribution-to-the-community---%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E8%B0%9C%E9%A2%98%E7%B4%A2%E5%BC%95-chinese-puzzle-index-%E9%9B%AA%E5%84%BF-kinami">中国谜题索引</a>, which I contributed a little, but I am not the main contributor). Furthermore, I am not <a href="#lifetime-achievement-award---sevenking">SEVENKING</a>.</p>
<p>This year's Bravo Awards see a lot of Chinese nominations, almost one in every category. Non-Chinese speakers might find it unpleasant as the language barrier makes it difficult to appreciate these entries, and I have seen some discussions of this kind. In this post I will introduce these entries and hopefully can help non-Chinese speakers appreciate them.</p>

</ul>
<p>MiaoHunt 2023 is a large hunt organized by MiaoMiaoMiao. It is overall a great puzzle hunt, and the best part is its structure.
All feeder puzzles form a complete and complex structure which is gradually revealed through multiple meta puzzles.</p>
<p>See <a href="#round-of-the-year---backstage-miao23">Round of the Year - Backstage (Miao23)</a> and <a href="#best-meta-puzzle---%E6%A2%A6%E5%B9%BB%E5%B2%9B%E7%9A%84%E7%9C%9F%E6%AD%A3%E7%A7%98%E5%AF%86-true-secret-of-neverland-miao23">Best Meta Puzzle - 梦幻岛的真正秘密 (True Secret of Neverland) (Miao23)</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Fishunt is a hunt designed mainly by 鱼左 (FishLeft). This hunt is themed around art and many puzzles <span class="spoiler">involve non-trivial art knowledge</span>. I have seen discussions (in both Chinese- and English-speaking communities) about certain fields are underrepresented in puzzle hunts and this is a good example of an arty hunt.</p>
<details>
  <summary>Words from 鱼左 (FishLeft)</summary>
  Fishunt is a lightweight puzzle hunt featuring art and design. The hunt will wow you with the elaborate illustrations at your first glance, and wow you again with the ingenious ideas as well as the various art forms contained inside, at your eureka moment. Moreover, you will be amused by the humorous language style which makes your journey full with joy and laughter. I'd like to recommend you try Fishunt now!

<li><a href="https://mh2023.puzzlehunt.cn/admin/puzzle">Link</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This rounds consists of <span class="spoiler">three smaller rounds</span>. Each puzzle <span class="spoiler">has three different (but closely related) versions, used in each of the small rounds</span>.
Each puzzle <span class="spoiler">has a unique extraction method</span>, which is <span class="spoiler">used repeatedly in the small metas</span>.
Then <span class="spoiler">the meta meta</span> gives hint of deeper structure used in the final meta.</p>

</ul>
<p>The entire round is in the form of manga. Every puzzle (except for one) is a one-page manga. Most puzzles (including the meta) <span class="spoiler">use in depth the manga format in the solving path</span>.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://pnku3.pkupuzzle.art/area?dst=day3">Link</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Every feeder puzzle in this round <span class="spoiler">uses aspects of the protagonist (e.g., the favorite poem of the protagonist) in the solve path</span>.
Players need to <span class="spoiler">figure out the correct answer to the aspects to solve the puzzle</span>.
However, <span class="spoiler">the protagonist has three different versions</span>, leading to <span class="spoiler">three different answers for each of the aspects</span>.
Using <span class="spoiler">different answers to each aspect</span>, <span class="spoiler">the feeder puzzles could have multiple answers (different or same)</span>.
There are three meta puzzles, <span class="spoiler">corresponding to three different versions of the protagonist</span>.</p>
<h3 id="best-direction---pku3">Best Direction - P&amp;KU3</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pnku3.pkupuzzle.art/home">Link</a></li>
<li>To clarify, this is Part 1 of P&amp;KU3. Part 2 and 3 of P&amp;KU3 are planned for 2025 and 2026 respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since <a href="https://archive.cipherpuzzles.com/index.html#/index?c=ccbc11/index">CCBC11</a>, Chinese puzzle hunts tend to put much emphasis on the overall structure and the final meta(s). This is great but increases construction difficulty and precludes certain kinds of novelties. P&amp;KU3 (Part 1) explores a new direction by emphasizing special round structures and downplaying the global structure (similar to most MIT Mystery Hunts). It even does not have a final meta because this is only part 1 of a planned three-part hunt. The puzzles overall have high quality. Furthermore, the designer (Winfrid) puts a lot of effort (and money) on character design, art and story.</p>

<p>Feeder answers in this round have a great variety, including Chinese, English, and <span class="spoiler">a date</span>.
In this meta puzzle, one needs to <span class="spoiler">associate each feeder answer with a phrase in Chinese, which contains numbers in the characters</span>.
Then <span class="spoiler">these numbers are put into an infinite recursive logic puzzle (fillomino)</span>, and <span class="spoiler">the remaining parts of the Chinese characters are used for extraction</span>.
The solution <span class="spoiler">to the logic puzzle has exactly one infinite region</span>, and <span class="spoiler">by combining Chinese character parts in the region one gets the final answer</span>,
which is <span class="spoiler">an infinite periodic string &quot;……梦中的梦中的梦中的梦……&quot; (literal translation: &quot;... dream in a dream in a dream in a ...&quot;)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="lifetime-achievement-award---sevenking">Lifetime Achievement Award - SEVENKING</h3>
<p>SEVENKING has made substantial contributions to the Chinese puzzle hunt community in the past 15+ years. His contributions include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>SEVENKING created the first <a href="https://cipherpuzzles.com/#/">CCBC</a> (the largest and earliest puzzle hunt series in China) in 2008. He is the main organizer of the CCBC series and does most if not all sponsorship, art, and PR. SEVENKING is the owner of 密码菌 (Mimajun), the organization that hosts every year's CCBC.</li>
<li>SEVENKING is main moderator of <a href="https://tieba.baidu.com/f?kw=%E5%AF%86%E7%A0%81">Baidu Cipher Tieba</a> since 2008. Baidu Cipher Tieba used to be the largest Chinese community for discussing classical ciphers and hunt-style puzzles. The first two CCBCs were hosted on this platform, and before 2016 (CCBC9), most discussions of CCBC and puzzle hunts in China happened here.</li>
<li>SEVENKING is the main moderator of the CCBC QQ Group, currently the second-largest Chinese community that discusses puzzle hunts, with about 2000 members.</li>
<li>SEVENKING is the maintainer of <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/410776729/">Bilibili account of 密码菌</a> and Wechat official account of 密码菌.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it is fair to say that the Chinese puzzle hunt community would not exist without his efforts.</p>
